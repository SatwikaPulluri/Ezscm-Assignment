These colors are arranged in a specific order, often remembered using the acronym ROY G. BIV.\n\n3. This order represents a gradual shift in wavelength of light, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest.\n\n4.  It is important to note that a rainbow is a continuous spectrum of colors, and the distinct bands we see are a simplification of this spectrum."
